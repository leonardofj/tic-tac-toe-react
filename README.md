### Next steps
-Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.
-Bold the currently selected item in the move list.
-Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
-Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
-When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
-When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
